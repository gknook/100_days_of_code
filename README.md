## Mimi Challenge Instructions

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo
2. Do *anything* re: code once per day for 100 days
3. put that thing in a folder with the number of the day and, optionally, a title
4. share what you've learned

### Wait why?

Learning is fun! This is meant to provide a public scratchpad where we can
teach each other things outside of the usual routine.

### Okay how again?

Spend a little time every day learning something new about programming computers,
share your work, get feedback, and check out what other people are doing.

### Tips

- ask other people what they're working on
- combine it with other things in your life
- big projects are cool but try to keep these small
- it takes ~21 days to make a habit even if 100 sounds like too much try to
  stick with it every day until then.
- not every submission has to be code
