### Status Day 9
- EJ exercises 5.3 & 5.4
- - 5.3: Quite difficult to actually get right, had to take a look at the solution to figure it out. And even that solution was slightly beyond my initial understanding. Do, after looking at it, understand it now, but won't be able to reproduce it directly yet.
- - 5.4: Here I came to something quicker, though I selected the function forEach wrongly vs. the simple for (var i.. ) loop.
